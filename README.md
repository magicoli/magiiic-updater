Deliver updates for plugins provided by https://magiiic.com

## Description

This should deliver updates for plugins provided by https://magiiic.com.

However this project just started. So this plugin does nothing yet, or worst, does random things.

## Note to myself

- add metabox libraries
- Config page, set wppus url
- fetch available plugins from wppus
- fetch installed plugins, filter those handled by wppus
- run update code for those plugins

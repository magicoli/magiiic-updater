Deliver updates for plugins provided by https://magiiic.com

== Description ==

This should deliver updates for plugins provided by https://magiiic.com.

However this project just started. So this plugin does nothing yet, or worst, does random things.

== Note to myself ==

* add metabox libraries
* Config page, set wppus url
* fetch available plugins from wppus
* fetch installed plugins, filter those handled by wppus
* run update code for those plugins

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0 =
* initial config and libraries, ready for real work
